### Art

We look forward to providing players with better promotional art. Regarding that we ask you to follow some simple rules:
- avoid overloaded graphics with a ton of polygons and curves,
- make sure it follows color scheme provided with logotype and previous promotional art,
- prefer vector graphics when it comes to simpler forms and reusability factor.

### Processes

Making process diagrams in universal form, which is BPMN, is the part of agreeable comprehension.

We use Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) to describe all possible activities in gameplay and have a perspective look on its extension.

Use [Camunda Modeler](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/) to edit or create BPMN diagrams. It's quite a good tool, I tested! ðŸ’¯
